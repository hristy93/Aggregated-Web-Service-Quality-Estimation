# Aggregated Web Service Quality Estimation
A web app for aggregated quality estimation of some web services.

## Description
This is the thesis for my master's degree in Software Technologies in the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University.
The aim of the thesis is to develop such a software tool that provides an aggregated estimation of web services based on accumulated metrics data of their qualitative characteristics. That way the users of the system are assisted in the process of choosing an appropriate web service

## Functionalities
The main functionalities of the web application are:
 - input web service metrics data by:
   - uploading 2 CSV files (1 per service) or
   - initiating load and performance tests which generate the data
 - display the web service metrics data in charts and tables
 - display the results of the estimators
 
## Algorithms and methods for aggregated quality estimation (estimators)
 - Statistical analysis
 - Apdex (Application Performance Index) score
 - Cluster analysis (Subtractive clustering)
